|LS| Useful QGIS Plugins
===============================================================================

Now you can install, enable and disable plugins. Let's see how this can help
you in practice by looking at some examples of useful plugins. 

**The goal for this lesson:** To familiarize yourself with the plugin interface
and get acquainted with some useful plugins.

.. |basic| |FA| The Raster Terrain Analysis Plugin
.. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.. 
.. * Start a new map with only the :guilabel:`srtm_41_19.tif` raster dataset in it
..   (look in :kbd:`exercise_data/raster/SRTM`).
.. 
.. From the lesson on raster analysis, you're already familiar with raster
.. analysis functions. You used GDAL tools (accessible via :guilabel:`Raster -->
.. Analysis`) for this. However, you should also know about the Raster Terrain
.. Analysis plugin. This ships standard with newer versions of QGIS, and so you
.. don't need to install it separately.
.. 
.. * Open the :guilabel:`Plugin Manager` and check that the Raster Terrain
..   Analysis plugin is enabled:
.. 
..   .. image:: ../_static/qgis_plugins/026.png
..      :align: center
.. 
.. * Open the :menuselection:`Raster` menu. You should see a
..   :menuselection:`Terrain analysis` submenu.
.. * Click on :menuselection:`Terrain analysis --> Relief` to open this dialog:
.. 
..   .. image:: ../_static/qgis_plugins/027.png
..      :align: center
.. 
.. * Save the new file under :kbd:`exercise_data/plugins/relief.tif` (create a new
..   folder if necessary).
.. * Leave the :guilabel:`Output format` and :guilabel:`Z factor` unchanged.
.. * Check the box :guilabel:`Add result to project`.
.. * Click the :guilabel:`Create automatically` button. The list below will be
..   populated:
.. 
..   .. image:: ../_static/qgis_plugins/028.png
..      :align: center
.. 
..   These are the colors that the plugin will use to create the relief.
.. * If you like, you can change these colors now. For example:
.. 
..   .. image:: ../_static/qgis_plugins/029.png
..      :align: center
.. 
.. * Click :guilabel:`OK` and the relief will be created:
.. 
..   .. image:: ../_static/qgis_plugins/030.png
..      :align: center
.. 
.. This achieves a similar effect to when you used the semi-transparent hillshade
.. as an overlay over another raster layer. The advantage of this plugin is that
.. it creates this effect using only one layer.

|basic| |FA| The OpenLayers Plugin
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Start a new map with only the :guilabel:`streets` layer in it.
* Using the :guilabel:`Plugin Installer`, find the plugin by entering the word
  :kbd:`Open` in the :guilabel:`Filter` field.
* Select the Google Layers plugin from the filtered list:

  .. image:: ../_static/qgis_plugins/020.png
     :align: center

* Click the :guilabel:`Install plugin` button to install.
* When it's done, close the :guilabel:`Plugin Installer`.
* Open the :guilabel:`Plugin Manager`.
* Enable the new plugin:

  .. image:: ../_static/qgis_plugins/021.png
     :align: center

* Check the box beside it.
* Now click :guilabel:`OK` to enable the plugin.

To use the plugin:

* Open the plugin by clicking on :menuselection:`Plugins --> Open Layers --> Settings`.
* Use the dialog to choose a map type you want. In this example, we'll use the
  "Add Google Satellite Layer" type map, but you can choose any others if you want.
  
* Enable "on the fly" projection and use the Google Mercator projection:

  .. image:: ../_static/qgis_plugins/023.png
     :align: center

You should now have a new raster image in from Google that you can use as a
backdrop, or to help you find out where you are on the map. Here is such a
layer, with our own vector road layer as overlay:

   :align: center

|moderate| |FA| The OpenStreetMap Plugin
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since we're using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data in our examples, it would be
instructive to know where it comes from. QGIS has a plugin that allows you to
download and edit this kind of data easily.

* First, ensure that you have the plugin installed by opening the
  :guilabel:`Plugin Installer` and filtering on the word :kbd:`street`:

  .. image:: ../_static/qgis_plugins/006.png
     :align: center

* The :guilabel:`OpenStreetMap plugin` should be installed by default, but if
  it isn't, you can get it by clicking the :guilabel:`Install plugin` button.
* Once it's installed, activate it via the :guilabel:`Plugin Manager`.
* A new buttons and, if activated in :menuselection:`View --> Panels --> OSM Feature`, 
a new panel will be added to your interface:

  .. image:: ../_static/qgis_plugins/007.png
     :align: center

Let us download data for Bandung. The plugin will download data for the area
currently on your map.

* Zoom in to the Bandung area.
* To add data, click on the :guilabel:`Download OSM data` button:

  .. image:: ../_static/qgis_plugins/008.png
     :align: center

.. note:: You may see a message stating that the latitude, longitude, or both
   extents are too large. This is because the OSM server doesn't have the
   capacity to continually give people data about the whole world. To prevent
   people trying to download too much data, there's a limit to the size of the
   area for which you can download data. If you get one of these error
   messages, zoom in to a smaller area on the map.

* If you have an acceptable area, you can leave the other options as default
  and click the :guilabel:`Download` button.
* After a while, the data will be downloaded, and will be shown in your map
  automatically. Here's an example:

  .. image:: ../_static/qgis_plugins/011.png
     :align: center

..  (The labels are added from our local data for identification purposes.)

With any of the OSM layers selected in your :guilabel:`Layers list`, the
buttons in the plugin's dock panel will become active:

.. image:: ../_static/qgis_plugins/012.png
   :align: center

* Using the plugin's own :guilabel:`Identify feature` tool (at the far left of
  the above buttons), click on any feature in the OSM layers to retrieve its
  data and see it displayed in the plugin interface. For example, clicking on
  the polygon near the top of the screen in our example shows it is a golf course:

  .. image:: ../_static/qgis_plugins/013.png
     :align: center

* You can create new features (point, lines, polygons) as well as edit a
  feature that you have identified. For example, using the plugin's
  :guilabel:`Identify feature` tool as before, you can click on this polygon 
  and see that it is a forest without a name:

  .. image:: ../_static/qgis_plugins/014.png
     :align: center

..   Looking at its attributes, it doesn't have a name:
.. 
..   .. image:: ../_static/qgis_plugins/015.png
..      :align: center
.. 
* Double-click in the :guilabel:`<new tag here>` field.
* Select a new tag (attribute) from a list. Let's choose :guilabel:`name`:

  .. image:: ../_static/qgis_plugins/016.png
     :align: center

* Double-click in the :guilabel:`Value` field:

  .. image:: ../_static/qgis_plugins/017.png
     :align: center

You can now enter a name for the forest. You can save your changes to the original 
source data, too. This makes the changes available internationally on the OSM server.

* Click the :guilabel:`Upload OSM data` button:

  .. image:: ../_static/qgis_plugins/018.png
     :align: center

  This gives you a dialog, which you can fill in as needed.
* If you have a user account at OSM, you can enter your credentials in the
  spaces provided and click the :guilabel:`Upload` button to save those
  changes.

Note that the plugin has many other functions: for example, you can also save
OSM layers to a local directory, load data from saved OSM layers, and export
OSM data as shapefiles.

OSM's data comes from, and is maintained by, the efforts of their users.
Contributing data using this plugin allows you to help improve the quality of
the OSM data you depend on.

There are many useful plugins available for QGIS. Using the built-in tools for
installing and managing these plugins, you can find new plugins and make
optimum use of them.

Now we will look at combining some of the skills you have learnt in a practical 
exercise involving data from iSIKHNAS.
